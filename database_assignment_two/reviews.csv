1,1,First you should know the community is extremely toxic. Even in casual. People take the game seriously so there are plenty of trolls that get fed up and try to throw. Don't worry too much though just focus on doing your own thing and enjoy the game. Mute the people being toxic and be done with it.,8,2015-10-10
1,2,A great game to satisfy your competitive itch. Constantly updated. New content frequently.,9,2016-01-17
2,3,"THE GAME IS 10/10 and fun to play, if you can even play it.",2,2022-02-28
3,4,Isaac is an awesome roguelike game with infinite replayability. It's tough at first but as you get better at the game you will appreciate it more and more for the unique experience it provides. Every run feels different and even after getting close to 2k hours of playtime I still discover new things.,7,2015-01-08
5,5,"Very repetitive and bland gameplay. If you played one level you've played them all. It doesn't even come as a complete game, you need to buy DLC to get the more varied gameplay missions and the rest of the classic mechs. I love the Battletech Franchise but this game missed the mark by so far that I cannot recommend.",3,2018-05-19
5,1,"This game is an, as close as I've seen so far, translation of the tabletop Battletech game to PC. While it doesn't quite have the depth of full combined arms found in the significantly older (but somewhat unobtainable) Mech Commander 2, I found this game very enjoyable.",7,2018-06-01
5,2,"Great game with lots of replayability, highly recommend if you're into the mech warrior universe or love turn based strategy games.",9,2019-01-03
6,3,You will want to kill yourself every time you die but other than the increasing suicidal urge its pretty cool. got some back story and some cool mechanics.,6,2018-08-07
6,4,"There's no feat harder than finding the perfect balance between difficulty and reward in a rouge-like games, and I think the devs botched this gem with their last update.",3,2019-02-27
8,5,So much hours yet so little progress.....,8,2015-12-20
8,1,"Fallout New Vegas is the best game I have ever played. This is no New Vegas. However, it is still a good time and worth sinking a few hours into regardless of your personal love for Vegas or FO3.",9,2016-01-31
8,2,"It's lesser fallout than New Vegas, But more than Fallout 76.",5,2019-02-10
8,3,Guess I won't surprise anyone.,1,2020-01-01
10,4,"Rage is the kind of game that really makes me wish steam had a ""Meh"" option. Rage isn't good enough for me to recommend it, but it isn't bad enough for me to condemn it and in a way that's worse than it being bad.",2,2015-06-03
10,5,RAGE is a great game at first. Everything feels unique.,6,2017-01-27
11,1,Play this amazing game one last time for all your Ukrainian Stalker brothers.,10,2022-01-01
12,2,Good game!,9,2020-09-01
13,3,The tried and true Dark souls formula with enough variations to keep it fresh so it's not a straight up copy.,8,2020-01-17
13,4,Miles better than the first one both in quality of life as well as general gameplay. Still too busy with the cutting mechanic and the directional block. Could have solved the block with Parry/I-frames.,3,2020-03-20
14,5,Good game nearly destroyed by the developers stupid stubbornness in enforcing a one-save system,4,2019-07-01
15,1,A decent game that tries too hard to be like Dark Souls and feels more like a 'slimmed' down Borderlands.,3,2019-08-20
15,2,"Before i bought the game, during a sale, i never heard of this game. I just read co-op and saw it had positive reviews so i bought it.",7,2020-01-02
15,3,Great coop game! I recommend.,10,2021-09-24
16,4,Hours of fun.,10,2010-10-23
16,5,My friends like to beat the living crap out of me every time we play.,1,2010-12-05
17,1,"I'm an idiot for not playing this earlier, this is actually great : the game",10,2015-05-18
17,2,"If you check my game collection and hours played, you'll notice I'm a shooter kind of a guy. That's for games. I really do love a good story in a movie, a book or a series though.",8,2015-06-19
17,3,Best Game Ever?,10,2015-06-19
17,4,not epic,1,2022-01-17
18,1,Probably the most fun you can get for $10 on the entire Steam platform. Truly incredible game that never fails to be a blast with friends.,9,2016-01-19
19,1,A lot of this game's reported difficulty actually comes from the game itself not explaining things very well.,4,2020-02-06
19,2,"The game has potential. The rub is that the devs care a little too much about balance and not nearly enough about content, fun, epic moments etc... Hopefully it all pans out in the end.",8,2021-01-19
19,3,prepare to mine your salt. games fun but super punishing.,7,2020-08-18
19,4,Stoneshard is a dissapointing early access title.,1,2021-09-28
20,5,"I got this for free on Epic, but bought it on Steam because I was enjoying myself so thoroughly that I felt I should do track progress with achievements. I've started this game 3 times now and I just finished 1 ending. So, maybe 40 hours total. I messed around a whole bunch, but I was extremely satisfied with how it played.",8,2017-05-04
20,1,"Wonderful game, lots of suspense",9,2018-01-19
20,2,This is a good game that I couldn't bring myself to finish.,2,2020-02-02
20,1,i love sticking purple goop in my eye this is genuinely such a fun and good game its like my favorite ever thank you,7,2021-01-01
20,4,yes,10,2018-07-07
20,5,... BAD game!,1,2022-01-02
